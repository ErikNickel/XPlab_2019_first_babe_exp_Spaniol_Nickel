In this task we took the departure point and changed it to a basic version of the mental rotation task.

We follow the instructions to instantiate your own experiment based on the “departure point”, created a repository for own experiment,and change the “departure point” template as instructed. (replaced the 2-alternative forced choice task with a key-press task, instantiated five trials of a key-press task, the key presses are recorded as “same” and “different”, one of the mental-rotation pictures is obtainable here on each trial. The key press choices are coded as “correct” or “incorrect” based on the picture shown. To each trial it was further added which number of picture shown it was, what degree of rotation the picture had, and whether the picture’s objects are indeed “same” or “different”. Moreover, we also shuffle the 5 images.
